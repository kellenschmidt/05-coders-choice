Please write a couple of sentences explaining your choice of restart
strategy.

For the supervision restart strategy of my hangman application I 
have selected `:permanent`, because the hangman is required to 
use the human_player application, so if a hangman process stops 
unexpectedly/abnormally then it will need to be restarted so that 
the human_player interface can continue to be used.
