## Proposed Project

> Replace this paragraph with the description of what your project
> will do. Tell me what kind of interface it will have, and roughly
> how it will work. I don't need more than three or four sentences,
> unless you feel compelled to write more.

My application will be a homework tracking app for students. The
purpose of the application is to help students keep track of their
homework and exams. Students will be able to add homework assignments
and exams to the application and clissify them by course and add due
dates. The application will then organize all of the information and
display it to the student in a manner which helps them stay organized
and complete assignments on time.

## Outline Structure

> Describe how you'll organize your code. What is the process and
> supervision structure? If it uses a framework, how does it fit in. I
> just need to understand the direction you plan to take. Again, three
> or four sentences are probably enough.

My application will have a Phoenix framework web interface for
students to interact with. The application will use Ecto to store, 
assess, and modify the data which is inputted by users. There will be
a module managing the interface of the application, a module for
communicating with the database, and 1 or more module for managing the
state of the application as it is being used. All of these modules will
have a supervising module.
